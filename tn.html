            <p>Before you begin, you may want to know a couple of typing rules:
            <ol>
                <li>Never look at the keyboard (when you're starting it is okay but don't get used to looking). If you do then you will type slower and that is not what you want.
                <li>Unless if you have to sneeze or if you have to use the mouse, keep you fingers on the home row.
                <li>At least try. If you never try then you will never fail but if you never fail you will never succeed.
            </ol>
            <p>There are some exceptions to these, (not the third one) but almost every rule has an exception.
            <h1>numbers</h1>
            <p>You n0w know every 1etter on the key board 2 type. It took 3 rows of typing to get here and there are 4 rows in total (unless you count the <span class='under'>f</span>unction row, then there are 5 rows.) That implies that ther6 is only one row to go (discluding the <span class='under'>f</span>unction row). while were on the topic of numbers, why did 789 (this is not seven hundred eighty nine, but seven ate nine)? Answer: seven has a big mouth (have you noticed that I used every number in order in this one paragraph?). <a href = "tl.html">Practice now.</a></p>
