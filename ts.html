            <h1 id="rules">Rules</h1>
            <p>Before you begin, you may want to know a couple of typing rules:
            <ol>
                <li>Never look at the keyboard (when you're starting it is okay but don't get used to looking). If you do then you will type slower and that is not what you want.
                <li>Unless if you have to sneeze or if you have to use the mouse, keep you fingers on the home row.
                <li>At least try. If you never try then you will never fail but if you never fail you will never succeed.
            </ol>
            <p>There are some exceptions to these, (not the third one) but almost every rule has an exception.
                <h1 id="shift">shift</h1>
                <p>There is one difference about shif; it doesn't put anything on the screen by itself. Insted, it modifies, or changes, the other key you typed*. For example, when the "a" key is combined with shift, it creates "A".when ";" is combined with shift, it makes ":". How do you know how it alters the keys? The character on the bottom of the key, as you may have noticed, is the non-modified character, and the top one is.
                <h1 id="p">practice</h1>
                <p><a href = "tl.html">Practice now.</a></p>
            </div>
            <!--footer-->
            <footer>
                <p>*shift is not the only one that modifies. Ctrl, function, alt, command, and the windows key are all modifiers too.
            </footer>
