        <div>
            <h1 id="rules">Rules</h1>
            <p>Before you begin, you may want to know a couple of typing rules:
            <ol>
                <li>Never look at the keyboard. When you're starting it is okay but don't get used to looking. If you do then you will type slower and that is not what you want.
                <li>Unless if you have to sneeze or if you have to use the mouse, keep you fingers on the home row.
                <li>At least try. If you never try then you will never fail but if you never fail you will never succeed.
            </ol>
            <p>There are some exceptions to these, not the third one, but almost every rule has an exception.
            <h1 id = 'vm'>v and m</h1>
            <p>After all of this typing, you may wonder why the keyboard has the letters scrambled. The reason why is <a href="https://computer.howstuffworks.com/question458.htm">in this link</a>. <a href = "tl.html">Practice now.</a></p>
            <h1 id = 'c'>c</h1>
            <p>Remember the ecception with "a" not having a (this a is "a" as a word set? This is another ecception to that. <a href = "tl.html">Practice now.</a></p>
            <h1 id = 'x'>x</h1>
            <p>Two pairless letters in a row. Why didn't pair them up together? The reasons: 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>They use different fingers. "c" uses (or is it "'c' Uses"?) the middle finger and x uses the ring finger.
                <li>So I could make this list.
                <li>Why not?
            </ul>
            <a href = "tl.html">Practice now.</a>
            <h1 id = 'z'>z</h1>
            <p>You are now at the last letter.  the letters a ... not b or n yet (and you thought you were finished with typing). Even though we are at the last letter does not mean anything. We still have b, n, numbers, f1-12, shift, ctrl, alt, function ... were not even Â½ way there yet. <a href = "tl.html">Practice now.</a></p>
            <h1 id= 'bn'>b and n</h1>
            <p>I have two comments. one, you were expecting another pairless (I think that is a word, is it?) letter, right?  Nope, not another one. Two, if you think that the bottom row takes <span class="st">alot</span> a lot of streching fingers, the numeral and f1-12 rows will be a nice treat. <a href = "tl.html">Practice now.</a></p>
