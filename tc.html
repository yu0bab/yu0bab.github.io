        <div>
            <h1 id="rules">Rules</h1>
            <p>Before you begin, you may want to know a couple of typing rules:
            <ol>
                <li>Never look at the keyboard (when you're starting it is okay but don't get used to looking). If you do then you will type slower and that is not what you want.
                <li>Unless if you have to sneeze or if you have to use the mouse, keep you fingers on the home row.
                <li>At least try. If you never try then you will never fail but if you never fail you will never succeed.
            </ol>
            <p>There are some exceptions to these, (not the third one) but almost every rule has an exception.
            <h1 id="minus">- and =</h1>
            <p>A couple notes bofore we start:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>There are only two characters that don't need the pinky finger; "," and "`". The others do.
                <li>I will not mention all 32 characters on this lesson: just 11 of them. The others will be told of in the next lesson.
                <li>The key board only give you a taste of the characters. There are at least a MILLION (the Μillion (That is not a capital M, but the greek letter mu) told of in the extra section).
            </ul><p><a href = "tl.html">Practice now.</a></p>
            <h1 id="brackets">[ and ]</h1>
            <p>These two characters are two of the least used characters in english, but the most popular in programming. In programming (no, programmers are not pros at grammer, but at programming) they are used for making a list.
            <ul>
                <li>Like this one, but at the same time not like this one.
                <li>It isn't realy a list if there is only one item on the list</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>you can make lists inside lists!
                    <li>it's no list with one item
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <p><a href = "tl.html">Practice now.</a></p>
            <h1 id="semi">; and '</h1>
            <p>The semicolon (;) is used almost everywhere! In grammer, it combines like sentences. It also shows the end of a ''sentence'' in programming ,unlike in grammer, when the end of a sentence is a period, question mark, or exclamation point. Emojis like these for eyes (;D &lt;--- see?). The single quote (') is just as popular. In both grammer and programming, they are used for dialogue. They are also handy for emoji tears :'D. It works in this font, but not in some others. <a href = "tl.html">Practice now.</a> No, not on emoji making.</p>
            <h1 id='comma'>, and .</h1>
            <p>Have you realized that so far eveery character in this lesson had something in the top half? These two are axeptions. The periods (. notice that there is nothing in the top.) shows the end of a sentence. I don' t have an idea of what a period could be for an emoji.  In grammer, they define a comma (,. they look so similar) as a seperation. Like the single quote, a.k.a apostrophe, the comma is nice for a tear :,D. <a href = "tl.html">Practice now</a></p>
            <h1 id="slash" title=" bruh why not just read the paragragh already!">/ and \</h1>
            <p>The foward slash, /, is found everywhere! In dates, like 8/8/8, or math, like 4/3. On websites, like yubab.github.io/tc.html, or emojis :/. in measutments, 2yd./6ft. In  files, shape/square/area.txt. The back slash, \, is rare. The one time I can think of is when yo want a space <br><br>like this. <a href = "tl.html">Practice now</a></p>
            <h1 id="null">`</h1>
            <p>... I don't know :'(.</p>
