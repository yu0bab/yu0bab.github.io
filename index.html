        <div>
            <h1 id="rules">Rules</h1>
            <p>Before you begin, you may want to know a couple of typing rules:
            <ol>
                <li>Never look at the keyboard (when you're starting it is okay but don't get used to looking). If you do then you will type slower and that is not what you want.
                <li>Unless if you have to sneeze or if you have to use the mouse, keep you fingers on the home row.
                <li>At least try. If you never try then you will never fail but if you never fail you will never succeed.
            </ol>
            <p>There are some exceptions to these, (not the third one) but almost every rule has an exception.
            <h1 id="fjs">f, j, and space</h1>
            <p>Lets start with f and j. They are the ones with the bumps. To type them, you use your pointer (index) fingers. Left finger on the left letter (f) and vise versa (right finger on the right letter.) Your thumbs go on the space bar. The really wide one. <a href = "tl.html">Practice now.</a></p>
            <h1 id="dk">d and k</h1>
            <p>Now you know about the f and j keys, but what about the others? The next letters we will start with is d and k. Insted of your pointer fingers, we will use our middle fingers for these letters. Like as before, left on left and vice versa. Even if you are not using f, j, or space, still keep the right (as in correct) fingers on them.  <a href = "tl.html">Practice now.</a></p>
            <h1 id = "sl">s and l</h1>
            <p>That is d, f, j, k, and space down; five down, five to go. For s and l it is the ring fingers (see the pattern?). The same rules imply: </p><ul>
                <li>Never look at the keyboard (when you're starting it is okay but don't get used to looking). If you do then you will type slower and that is not what you want.
                <li>Unless if you have to sneeze or if you have to use the mouse, keep you fingers on the home row.
                <li>At least try. If you never try then you will never fail but if you never fail you will never succeed.
                <li>left (ring) finger on left letter (s) and vise versa.
            </ul>
            <p>The only difference to this is that this is s and l. <a href = "tl.html">Practice now.</a></p> 
            <h1 id = "a">a</h1>
            <p>You may have noticed that all of these lessons came in pairs, like f and j, d and k (another rule with another acception.) This is not one of those. The finger is your LEFT small finger. There is a character that is connected to the RIGHT finger, but we will not learn about it right now. <a href = "tl.html">Practice now.</a></p>
            <h1 id = 'gh'>g and h</h1>
            <p>Remember how there was an acception in the last lesson? Here is another one. When you type g and h, you don't develop two more fingers to type them (that would be a little odd); usualy, you stretch your pointer fingers over there. <a href = "tl.html">Practice now.</a></p>
